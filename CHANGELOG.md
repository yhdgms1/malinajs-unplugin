### Oh, and...

While testing the new esbuild support, I found that it was not working because of `Cannot find module 'malinajs'` error.
To fix this, I changed import to require, this is 'just works' and I'm not sure will it work in all cases.

Currently, import inside the plugin looks like this:

```ts
const malina = createRequire(import.meta.url)(
  path.join(process.cwd(), "node_modules", "malinajs")
);
```
